# Pointers-and-structures
List of small projects to show my work with pointers and structures

First, I pushed a fix to my project "ESP32-S3_Arduino_UART" where I added pointers to the parameters of the writeAccelGyroLog() function and slightly rewrote its logic:
https://github.com/Dyusha37/ESP32-S3_Arduino_UART

Then I asked ChatGPT to generate a few tasks on this topic. Here is the link to the solution. The problem statements are described in the project:
- Dynamic array of structures ‘Student’ https://wokwi.com/projects/446557103836195841
- List of employees with dynamic relationships (Linked list of structures) https://wokwi.com/projects/446643045939249153
- Book and author (Nested structures) https://wokwi.com/projects/446651166959941633

However, at first, I didn’t specify that these tasks should be related to Embedded development and working with the ESP32.
So later, I asked to generate them with this clarification. Here are the next tasks.
- Collecting sensor data in a structure https://wokwi.com/projects/446699994976046081
