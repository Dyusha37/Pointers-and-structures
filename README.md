# Pointers-and-structures
List of small projects to show my work with pointers and structures

First, I pushed a fix to my project "ESP32-S3_Arduino_UART" where I added pointers to the parameters of the writeAccelGyroLog() function and slightly rewrote its logic:
https://github.com/Dyusha37/ESP32-S3_Arduino_UART

Then I asked ChatGPT to generate a few tasks on this topic. Here is the link to the solution. The problem statements are described in the project:
- Dynamic array of structures ‘Student’ https://wokwi.com/projects/446557103836195841
- List of employees with dynamic relationships (Linked list of structures) https://wokwi.com/projects/446643045939249153
- Book and author (Nested structures) https://wokwi.com/projects/446651166959941633

However, at first, I didn’t specify that these tasks should be ***RELATED TO EMBEDDED DEVELOPMENT AND WORKING WITH THE ESP32***.
So later, I asked to generate them with this clarification. Here are the next tasks:
- Collecting sensor data in a structure https://wokwi.com/projects/446699994976046081
- Working with an array of structures (measurement history) https://wokwi.com/projects/446725734550580225
- Working with peripherals through pointer-based structures https://wokwi.com/projects/446735121591450625
- Device manager https://wokwi.com/projects/446743967989024769
- Sensor configuration in memory https://wokwi.com/projects/446795427154565121
- Network module with function pointers https://wokwi.com/projects/446816537417251841
- Device power manager https://wokwi.com/projects/446820132915490817
- Sensor network (dynamic linking of structures) https://wokwi.com/projects/446830265558276097
- Saving configuration to memory https://wokwi.com/projects/446909909769544705
- Command processing subsystem https://wokwi.com/projects/446918451480013825

Then I asked to add structures with ***BIT FIELDS*** to the tasks. Here are the next tasks:
- Working with a sensor data frame https://wokwi.com/projects/447995704851392513
- Power module status https://wokwi.com/projects/448016290306407425
- Union for interpreting raw bytes https://wokwi.com/projects/448091140577418241
- Forming a CAN message https://wokwi.com/projects/448101253102620673
- Peripheral configuration register https://wokwi.com/projects/448157491692908545
- Device control packet https://wokwi.com/projects/448181842691296257

In the end, I asked to generate a few OOP exercises:
- A class that uses a structure to store data https://wokwi.com/projects/448191158368567297
- Dynamic Structure Manager https://wokwi.com/projects/448234881154531329
- Structure + class = protocol object https://wokwi.com/projects/448273779804913665
- Inheritance + parameter structure https://wokwi.com/projects/448283545541131265
- Pointers to a base class with an internal structure https://wokwi.com/projects/448354197866859521
- An array of structures through a container class https://wokwi.com/projects/448360913460833281
- Union + class for interpreting bytes https://wokwi.com/projects/448454363218865153
- Function pointers + classes and structures https://wokwi.com/projects/448457065448682497
